<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> After the week before this past week, our last project was turned in. This past week was spent in presenting our project to the class as well as listening to everyone else also present their project. The presentation went well, and we were able to successfully deliver our website as the final project of software engineering. </p> 

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> There's quite a bit in my way for this week, as this tends to be the week that most "final" exams are given on. I have one exam on thursday and one exam on friday. The Thursday one involves this class but I will have to dedicate a lot of time to my other classes as well before I can dedicate all my time to studying for this exam. </p> 

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> This next week will consist of studying for my software engineering final exam. This exam involves a lot of different tools and languages like Java, Python, SQL, and XML. I will have to go over each of the concepts used for this portion of the class and review all of the concepts that I am still shaky on. After that, the class will come to a conclusion. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> My experience in this class has been very good, and it is now coming to a close. I have learned a lot about various tools and languages used in different aspects of software engineering. These tools will definitely come in handy in my career in the future, and I'm incredibly glad I was able to take this class. </p> 

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> My tip of the week for this last week is to continue your knowledge in the tools that may have been talked about in this class. Although diving into them is important, it is more important to hone skills by using the programs and tools over and over again to make sure the knowledge is never lost. </p>
