<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was very busy for this Software Engineering class, as it was the first week back from Spring Break. Spring Break provided a pretty large break in the normal work that I'm used to, and coming back was a lot at one time. Me and my group began working on the database project after Spring Break, and quickly made as much progress as possible. By working hours and hours every day, we were able to compeletely finish the first phase of the project. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> Last week, there were a few things in my way. First of all, I had a very bad family emergency that left me without someone I hold very dearly to my heart. Luckily this was over Spring Break, and not during a big workload, so it did not affect me in worse ways that it could have. After Spring Break, the thing getting in my way was not really knowing how to use the tools for the project. The APIs and frameworks were completely new to me, and me and my team had to figure them all out. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week is going to be a lot of the same things that I was doing this week. I believe me and my team will be meeting up for hours a day in order to finish the second phase of the data base web project. Unfortunately, I also have an exam in another class in that week, and that will most likely halt a lot of the work we get done in the next week. After that though will come the bulk of our work for this project. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> The experience in the class has been as great as ever in the past week, as we got to learn a lot more about SQL queries and certain functions you can make and use in Python that kind of go along with SQL. It's very interesting to see how certain languages tie in with one another even if they are many times used for completely different settings. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> My tip of the week is one that has been extremely helpful to me in the past couple weeks. This is a website that has fantastic tutorials on pretty much any software you could want to learn, w3schools. The link to the website can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">here</a>.
