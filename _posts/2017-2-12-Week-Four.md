<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week, I took a little break from doing software engineering projects in order to be able to focus on some of my other classes before starting the Netflix project. I have looked at and planned a little of the Netflix project with my partner, and we are going to start it soon this coming week. This week I focused mostly on the readings, including JavaScript and Extreme Programming, in order to understand the quizzes and the material during the lectures in class. I also spent time reviewing the notes of previous lectures to understand Python a little bit more. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> This week there was a good amount of work in my way in regards to my other classes. Unfortunately I am in three computer science classes and the other two require just as much work as Software Engineering. I spent a lot of time on readings and projects from the other 2 classes and they tend to take a lot of my time away from this class. Other than that, I do not have much in my way in terms of completing the projects in the class. I also didn't completely understand the lectures this week, however I went over them a few times for a better understanding of them. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week I will be to really start the second project, Netflix. I plan on meeting with my partner early in the week to plan exactly what we will do and get started with the setup. The setup tends to be half the battle when doing these projects, so if we can get the setup finished, the rest of it should be easily finished in the later half of the week. We are going to set up a schedule in order to work on Netflix as much as possible, and also possibly review the lectures from class. I will also be doing all of the reading from the new books in class in order to do well on the quizzes. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> My experience in the class this week has been right around the same as the previous weeks. The lectures tend to be pretty fast paced and more so focus on what the students know. Questions are asked to us for each segment of code and we are to answer on what the code actually does. I have learned a lot this way in terms of how Python really works, including the small details. Also we went over the new project in class in order to get started on the setup. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> In class we are learning a little of JavaScript using the book JavaScript The Good Parts, however there are many really good free resources out there to learn various languages. One of the books online for free to learn JavaScript is found here <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">here</a>. </p>
