<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was spent planning on how we were going to sort out some of the bugs that we had for the last phase of the project. We had a bug that was not allowing our website to be deployed properly because of how Google Cloud Platform deals with Postgre SQL. This week we came up with some solutions, including some that other students with the same problem had suggested. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> This week a couple things are in our way, including the few bugs that were mentioned earlier. We have some plans on how to take them on, and will implement them in the coming days. Also, each of our schedules tends to be very different, and working with different schedules sometimes results in not nearly as much work getting done. However, we have allocated tasks to each person and will get started soon. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week we will begin on the tasks that we have allocated to each person in the group. There are many tasks in this phase of the project, and because of the difference in scheduling between each of us, we each have tasks that we will begin this week. The project will be finished this week and our presentation should hopefully be finished planning as well. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> My experience in the class this week has been about the same as other weeks. We learned more SQL and some more Java concepts that may help us in our software engineering career. Going over various programming languages instead of just focusing on one throughout the semester helps to provide a wide range of skills that we can practice on throughout the class. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> If you are interested in programming, puzzles, or security challenges, I highly suggest checking out CTF (Capture the Flag) events happening online around the world. There are challenges for all levels, and for all types of skills. You can find out about various CTF events <a href="ctftime.org">here</a>!</p>
