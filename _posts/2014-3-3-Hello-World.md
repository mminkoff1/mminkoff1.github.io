<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week has been one of the more difficult first weeks of a semester, as my schedule was constantly changing throughout each day. I had started out not having this class on my schedule, and not having other classes I wanted, however luckily within the week I ended up getting put off the waitlist into this class. Prior to being put on the roster, I wanted to make sure that I knew exactly what was going on in all of my waitlisted classes, just in case I was to be put in them. The last thing I wanted to do was be behind a week into the semester. I read through all of the files for this class and made a calendar to keep track of the projects, quizzes, and exams that I would have to know soon enough. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> Before today, I had quite a lot in the way of where I wanted to be with this class and others. Mostly, the understaffed Computer Science department and the ridiculously difficult registration process to get the classes that I wanted. However, I knew this would be the case and planned to get around these barriers as fast as possible. Now that I have my schedule in order and the classes that I need, I don't have near as much in my way to be successful. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week is when the true programming begins for this class, as I didn't have much time to begin the first project last week. I have set aside enough time to get familiar with the setup, and am sure I know how to do the project as well as possible. It seems like a fun project, and I can't wait to get started. It may be a long week combined with all of my classes, but I believe I will be able to make it through. I will also be preparing for a certification that I have wanted recently called the CCENT certification. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> This past week, the class has been a bit of a roller coaster to get used to. This is not a negative thing at all, however much of the tools that we will be needing I have no experience with at all (such as Travis CI). Throughout the next few weeks I'm certain this will change. The lectures as a whole have been interesting, and my experience with Python has been brought back up after not coding in the language for quite a while. The quizzes are much more over the reading outside of class than anything inside of class, which is to be expected. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> If anyone is interested in cyber-security or any type of information security, a great organization called ISSS will be having their first semester meeting this Wednesday. Although it is not solely about software development, much of the security software in today's world was created by very intelligent software engineers and developers. </p>
