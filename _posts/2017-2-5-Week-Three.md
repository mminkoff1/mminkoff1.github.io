<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was when I really got into what software engineering in this class is about. It was just a quick look into the world of software engineering, however by doing a project using many interfaces and programs that I had never even heard of before, it was easy to see how all of these programs work together in order to create good software design and implementation. Lectures in class were more about the basics of Python rather than the Collatz project, however the Python lectures helped to guide us in the creation of the Collatz project later on in the week. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> This week I had a few other classes also creating projects and homework for us to do, so that did tend to get in the way of what I would have liked to do with the Collatz project. Luckily I was able to complete all of the assigned readings in the class and do as best as I could on the Collatz project. I would have liked to increase efficiency a little bit more, however I was able to meet the requirements for the project. Also, my knowledge of Python is not as great as other programming languages, so as projects go on, I will have to be learning more about the language in my own time. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week I will begin the second project of the class, and I believe it will be much more difficult and challenging than the first project was. Because of this, I will dedicate a lot of next week not only to the designated readings for the week, but also to learning more about Python as a language, and also how to implement it efficiently in order to help complete the projects as best as I can. I will try to start the project as early as possible so I can get as much of a head start as I need, as my other classes are also beginning to start their more difficult projects and I want to keep up as much as possible. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> My experience in the class this week was just about the same as the previous week. It was a bit challenging but nothing too difficult. The lectures were helpful in understanding confusing aspects of Python, and they helped to guide us into what techniques to implement ourselves when we started and finished our first project, Collatz. There does tend to be a good amount of information covered every day, and the readings even go over JavaScript as well. However, even though the class tends to be faster paced than most, the information covered in there is detrimental to understanding software engineering as a whole. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> I know that in this class, we use Travis CI for continuous integration and to track our git builds as much as possible. I had also heard of another continuous integration website and service that has good reviews by software engineers called Jenkins. The service is used for building and deploying alike, and can be found at the the website <a href="https://jenkins.io/index.html">here</a>. </p>
