<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was a bit troublesome in the fact that we had our first exam of the class on Tuesday. The exam had a review sheet given to us before we took the exam, which definitely helped. The beginning of the week involved me studying with a group in order to understand every concept on the review sheet and be prepared for the exam. After preparing, we took our exam on Tuesday. The exam wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, whether that be because I was prepared or because the exam was a bit easier than most. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> This week unfortunately there is quite a bit in my way in terms of workload. I have two other class exams this week, with them being scattered throughout the school week. I also have a project due at the end of the week and a couple homeworks due as well. In order to get all of this done I'll have to take a lot of time away from this class, and that unfortunately is the big thing in my way. Luckily we don't have anything due in this class soon so it won't be too big of a deal. </p> 

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week I really won't do much for this class except possible start the next project. I have a major project due right after spring break, which will take the majority of my time away. I plan on devoting a ton of my break time to a couple other classes, and devoting most of my time when I get back to this class. I will need to start on the new project as soon as possible to get a head start and not be behind in this class. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> This week in this class has been a good experience. I had my first exam, and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The lecture on Thursday was a guest lecturer so the material was not bad at all. Overall, this week has been less cumbersome than previous weeks, however I'm sure that will change in coming weeks when new, much more difficult, projects come along. </p> 

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> Many software developers do not only make software for businesses and other firms to use to help further their business or make it more efficient. There are a ton of game developers out there, and many of them use Unreal Engine to help fuel their game development. This is a fantastic engine to run a game on, and it can be found <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">here</a>.
