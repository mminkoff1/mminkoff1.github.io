<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was spent for the most part in the GDC lab working on phase two of the IDB project. Our game lookup project was looking really good, and we had the database up and running with all of the other tools that we were using for the project. Unfortunately, we didn't have much luck getting it to deploy with GCP, but that will be what we work on in the coming week. Other than that, I had to focus a lot on other classes' work as well. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> There is a pretty large thing that is in our way as a team for the IDB project. We have been using Postgre SQL along with SQLAlchemy with Google Cloud, and after trying for multiple hours to get GCP to launch our website that was hooked up to the database, it was just not going to work. We will have to come up with a work-around to get our website deployed with GCP in the coming phase. Also, many of us tend to not be too familiar with the toolset, but we are learning quickly. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week we are going to start phase 3 of the IDB project as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we procrastinated a bit on phase 2 because of the large workload of other projects, however this coming week I only have one other project due. We will be meeting each day to work closer to the finished website product with our database up to spec with the instructions. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> This week in this class has been beneficial, as we learned a lot about SQL and commands in python that can use SQL syntax. I did not have very much knowledge in these subjects beforehand, and the current project we are working on uses a lot of the same syntax. Class in general this week helped a lot in understanding exactly how to use SQL to handle our newly created database for our website. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> This Wednesday is Security Day at UT! If you're at all interested in cyber-security or information security, I highly recommend you come check out the event! Bring resumes as many large security companies will be there for recruiting, or just come have fun and participate in the 5 hour CTF challenge! </p>
