<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was a major milestone in this class as it involved the submission of the final project (IDB3) in the class. My team and I worked for very long amounts of time to get the project finally finished and ready for deployment and submission. This past week involved looking and populating through our database with more entries and keeping everything linked together and up to date. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> Luckily this past week, not much was in my team's way. Before this, we had some major bugs with the Postgre platform working with Google Cloud, however we were able to fix these bugs rather quickly and could deploy it without any problems. In the coming week, we will have to start studying for the final exam of this class, so in a way, studying for that is the one thing in our way. </p> 

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week, we can take a break from working on the website that we have been working on for the past month or so, and actually study for an exam. The exam will be the final in the entire class, so we should get a head start this coming week, although the exam is not until the week after this one. I will be going to class to learn the last bit of information that I need to know in order to finish up this class. </p> 

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> My experience in this class this week has been about the same as the other weeks. I have learned a lot about various tools and languages that I did not know prior to this class. I also learned a lot about working with other people on a team to accomplish one goal, by working for a month or so on the database project. </p> 

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> In order to seriously kick off your software engineering career, or any career in the field of computer science, I seriously recommend going to every single event possible that UT (or other groups in Austin) put on. Getting the contact information of other, older, people in the field is invaluable to getting the job that you want. </p>
