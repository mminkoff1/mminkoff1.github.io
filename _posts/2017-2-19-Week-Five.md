<b> What did you do this past week? </b>

<p> This past week was spent going through the rest of my Netflix project with my partner in order to finish all of the requirements before turning it in. The week before this week we were not able to get much done because of other classes, so this week was spent doing the bulk of the project. We were able to finish it easily in time, and could also do the readings for each of the classes in order to prepare for the quizzes. Also, I used the lectures to guide me to studying more on Python principles. </p>

<b> What's in your way? </b>

<p> This past week not much was in my way except for one other class in which I had a major exam in. This exam kept me from using a lot of my time for this class, and instead I had to study for it without paying too much mind to the Netflix project. Luckily I was able to complete the project easily before the due date so this did not get much in my way at all. Also, I didn't have too much time to do the readings in order to fully prepare for the quizzes because of the time constraints as well. </p>

<b> What will you do next week? </b>

<p> Next week I will begin the third project of this class in order to try to get a head start. I do have other projects also due next week that I will have to pay attention to, but I will try to give a decent amount of time to this class as well. We will also spend a couple days planning for the project, and I will spend a few hours reading for the quizzes that are always at the beginning of class. I will try to get started on my other class's projects as well so I don't have to spend a lot of time at the end of the week on all of them. </p>

<b> My experience in the class </b>

<p> This past week, my experience in this class was good. We had a guest speaker for one of the days and the TAs taught for the other day. The guest speaker had interesting things to say, and they definitely pertained to software engineering in order to help the students understand what their career may entail. Also, the TAs talked about certain Python characteristics that are very vague in the language and difficult to understand without proper lecture about them. </p>

<b> Tip-of-the-week </b>

<p> Though many people prefer not to use Integrated Development Environments when programming in certain languages, a very nice one that a lot of people use for Python is Pycharm. It is handy to use when programming quick scripts and provides many of the functions of a large IDE. You can find the download for PyCharm <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">here</a> </p>
